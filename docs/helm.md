# Helm Charts

This project provides Helm Charts to install `dex` and `dex-k8s-authenticator` into a Kubernetes cluster.

Follow the links for specific documentation on each chart:
- [dex-k8s-authenticator](../charts/dex-k8s-authenticator)
- [dex](../charts/dex)


Please note, that whilst we maintain our own `dex` chart, there is now an official version available in the main helm charts repo:
